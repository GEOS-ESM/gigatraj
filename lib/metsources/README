Updating variable lists for GMAO (MRRA, MERRA2, GEOSfpFcast, and GEOSfpAssim)
data sets:

The files *_Directory_Data.hh contain all of the information
about the meteorological fields that the respective data objects
can access. These are generated by Python scripts.

The first set of scripts actually query the OPeNDAP
servers of the respective data sources, and they output (to stdout)
a catalog of the variables and their characteristics:

  ./catalog_merra.py        >        MERRA_Directory_Data.ctg
  ./catalog_merra2.py       >       MERRA2_Directory_Data.ctg
  ./catalog_GEOSfpFcast.py  >  GEOSfpFcast_Directory_Data.ctg
  ./catalog_GEOSfpAssim.py  >  GEOSfpAssim_Directory_Data.ctg

The format of the ctg file is this:

It is a plain text file.
Each line describes one meteorological field variable from the data source.
Each lines consists of six text fields, separated by '@', as follows:
   - the name of the variable at the data source.
   - the number of dimensions of the data field. this wll be either 3 (longitude,latitude,time)
     for a 2D surface, or 4 (longitude, latitude, verticalCooridnate, time) for
     a 3D volume.
   - the "standard" name, usually according to the CF conventions.
   - the "long" descriptive name of the variable
   - the units of the variable
   - a description of where to find the variable. This is a list, of text sub-fields, separated by '|', 
     each of which describes a possible location and characteristics of the variable at that
     location. Each location is a list of sub-sub-fields, separated by ",", as follows:
       * a base URL with which the URL to access the variable begins
       * a supplemental string to be used in constructing the access URL
       * a file name string to be used in constructing the access URL. How this
         and the two previous sub-fields are to be sued on constructing the
         access URL, depends on the data set.
       * a code indicating the horizontal grid resolution
       * a code indicating the vertical grid coordinate (i.e., native-model or pressure)
       * the number of hours between time snapshots
       * a code indicating whether the data are averaged, instananeous, or constant
       * an offset, in minutes, of the first time snapshot from 00Z
       
Another script generates the *.hh files from the *.ctg files:
  ./ctg_2_hh.py   MERRA_Directory_Data.ctg  >  MERRA_Directory_Data.hh
  ./ctg_2_hh.py   MERRA2_Directory_Data.ctg > MERRA2_Directory_Data.hh

There is another wrinkle: the GEOSfp fields Do not include either a standard name or units.
We could get along without these, but it is convenient to have them. And since the MERRA/MERRA2
variables generally have the same names, we can generally take these from the MERRA/MERRA2
catalogs and add them to the GEOSfp catalogs.  This is done with the ctg_merge.py script:

    ./ctg_merge_py GEOSfpFcast_Directory_Data.ctg MERRA2_Directory_Data.ctg > GEOSfpFcast_Directory_Data_2.ctg
    ./ctg_2_hh.py GEOSfpFcast_Directory_Data_2.ctg > GEOSfpFcast_Directory_Data.hh

    ./ctg_merge_py GEOSfpAssim_Directory_Data.ctg MERRA2_Directory_Data.ctg > GEOSfpAssim_Directory_Data_2.ctg
    ./ctg_2_hh.py GEOSfpAssim_Directory_Data_2.ctg > GEOSfpAssim_Directory_Data.hh
