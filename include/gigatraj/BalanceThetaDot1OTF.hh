\brief class for adjusting the total time derivative of potential temperature  
(aka "potential temperature tendency", aka "theta dot") to force the net mass 
flux across each potential temperature surfaces to be zero.

\details

The BalanceThetaDot1OTF class provides a means of ensuring that the time rate of
change of air potential temperature is such that  global mass flux through a a set
of potential temperature ("theta") surfaces is zero.

Meteorological sources rarely if ever provide the time rate of change of air
potential temperature ("theta-dot") as such, but they often do provide other fields
from which this field can be calculated.  However, the resulting field may suffer
from biases.  One way to reduce the bias is to adjust the field on theta surfaces so
that no net global mass flux across those surfaces.  Strictly speaking, the net mass
flux across any given theta surface might not be zero at any given instant in time,
but  its time average should be zero.  And the error introduced by this
assumption seems to be less than the error incurred by using the unadjusted
theta-dot fields.

There are several ways this calculation might be done.  This version 
("1") is based on the technique used by Dr. Mark Schoeberl in his
"ftraj" trajectory model.  The input data objects used by this class
must be on isentropic aurfaces.  Theta-dot is multiplied by the air density
and a grid-point area weighting factor.  These values are summed over
the globe.  This total is then divided by the global total of the
area-weighted density to obtain an offset theta-dot value that is subtracted
from the theta-dot field at every grid point on that theta surface.
This procedure is applied only to theta surfaces at or below 500 Kelvin;
other theta surfaces are left unchanged.

Note that the calc() methods of this class take fields of the
GridField3D virtual class as input parameters and produce a new
GridField3D object as output.  Objects of any single subclass 
of GridField3D
may be used as inputs, so long as they are grid-compatible with each other,
and the return value will be of the same
subclass of GridField3D as the inputs.  However, the calling routine will
need to do a dynamic cast from GridField3D to the particular
subclass being used.
