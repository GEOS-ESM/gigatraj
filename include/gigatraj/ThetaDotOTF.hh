\brief class for computing the total time derivative of potential temperature  (aka "potential temperature tendency", aka "theta dot") from other meteorological data fields


\details

The ThetaDotOTF class provides GridField3D objects full of
the total time derivative of potential temperature, also known as potential
temperature tendency.  Since the traditional symbol for potential temperature
is theta, this quantity would be expressed as d(theta)/dt.  

Sources of gridded meteorological fields seldom provide potential temperature 
tendency as one of their products.
Nevertheless, this is a critical quantity to have when running
trajectories in quasi-isentropic coordinates, since it is the rate of
change of the parcel's vertical coordinate.  
Since potential temperature tendency is easily calculated
from other quantities that are commonly provided, the ThetaDotOTF class
ensures that Theta-Dot is always available from a given meteorological
source.

It is intended that this class be used by implementers of new
subclasses of MetGridData, to satisfy users' requests 
when the original data source does not provide the requested fields explicitly.
Note that the calc() methods of this class take fields of the
GridField3D virtual class as input parameters and produce a new
GridField3D object as output.  Objects of any single subclass of GridField3D
may be used as inputs, so long as they are grid-compatible with each other,
and the return value will be of the same
subclass of GridField3D as the inputs.  However, the calling routine will
need to do a dynamic cast from GridField3D to the particular
subclass being used.

Users should obtain their potential temperature tendency fields by requesting them
from a MetGridData subclass such as MetMERRA, rather than by
reading other fields and giving them to ThetaDotOTF.
