\brief loads Parcel state information from an istream

The StreamLoad class reads information 
from an input stream and loads it into a Parcel
object or collection of Parcel objects.  Note that
the Parcel or collection of Parcels must already
exist.

StreamLoad works as a counterpart to the StreamDump class,
to make it easy to save and restore Parcels.
It uses the Parcel class's ">>" operator
to pull state information from input stream. This means
that the information in the stream is limited to the time, longitude,
latitude, status, and flags; all these must be present.
