\brief loads Parcel state information from an istream

The StreamRead class reads information 
from an input stream and loads it into a Parcel
object or collection of Parcel objects.  Note that
the Parcel or collection of Parcels must already
exist.

StreamRead serves as a counterpart to the StreamPrint class.
It reads in the input stream, interpreting it 
according to a format specification.
Thus a high degrees of flexibility is allowed in how the information
in the input stream is arranged. Not all of the Parcel state has to
be specified, for example. That which is not specified is
inherited from a sample parcel.

      /// set the format for how a parcel state is to be read in
      /*! This method allows the user to specify the format in which a parcel's information is to be read in.
          The specification takes the form of a string with the following format:
          
          * Any text up to a "%" character is read from the inut, matched against the format, and discarded.
            If the input does not match the format, then an exception is thrown.
          
          * "%%" reads a "%" from the input and discards it. If the input character is not "%", an exception is thrown.
          
          * "%T" read the parcel's time, in the form of a (MetData-source-specific) Calendar time string, from
                 the input. Just plain "%T" reads the entire time string (i.e., all characters until
                 whitespace is encountered). Alternatively, fragments of a time string may be read in,
                 and then substituted into the correspnding characters in the parcel's current time specification.
                 A number inserted before the "T" (e.g., "%4T") is used as the length of the input, 
                 starting with the zeroeth character by default. If two numbers, separated by a period, are inserted
                 before the "T", the first number is the starting character if the time string string in pull from the input,
                 and the second number is the number of characters to pull. For example, if the parcel's current time
                 (before the input is read) is equivalent to "2017-03-14T14:35:15", and the input is "05-23T09",
                 the the format code "%5.8T" will result in the parcel's time being set to the equivalent of
                 "2017-05-23T09:35:15". (Note that StreamRead knows nothing about the semantics
                 of the calendar string.) A minus sign may be inserted just after the "%", but it will be ignored.
          
         * "%t" reads the parcel's time, as internal model time (not as a calendar time string).
           A number can be inserted in front of the "t" to specify the total length of the input field.
           If two numbers separated by a period are inserted, the first is an overall length
           and the second is the number of decimal places. A "-" inserted just after the "%" will be ignored.
          
         * "%o" reads the parcel's longitude, in numeric form positive east.
           A number can be inserted in front of the "o" to specify the total length of the input field.
           If two numbers separated by a period are inserted, the first is an overall length
           and the second is the number of decimal places. A "-" inserted just after the "%" is ignored.
          
         * "%a" reads the parcel's latitude, in numeric form positive north.
           A number can be inserted in front of the "a" to specify the total length of the input field.
           If two numbers separated by a period are inserted, the first is an overall length
           and the second is the number of decimal places. A "-" inserted just after the "%" is ignoed.
          
         * "%v" reads the parcel's vertical coordinate, according to the coordinate system being
           used to trace the parcels.
           A number can be inserted in front of the "v" to specify the total length of the input field.
           If two numbers separated by a period are inserted, the first is an overall length
           and the second is the number of decimal places. A "-" inserted just after the "%" is ignored.
          
         * "%g" reads the parcel's tag value.
           A number can be inserted in front of the "g" to specify the total length of the input field.
           If two numbers separated by a period are inserted, the first is an overall length
           and the second is the number of decimal places. A "-" inserted just after the "%" is ignored.
         
         * "%f" reads the parcel's flags. A number can be inserted in front of the "f" to specify the 
            total length of the input field.
          
         * "%s" reads the parcel's status. A number can be inserted in front of the "s" to specify the 
            total length of the input field.
          
         * "%i" reads the parcel's index number. Because such an index is not part of an parcel's state     
           (but assigned and managed by the model that tracks the parcels), this index is discarded ater    
           reading. This code exists for compatibility with the StreamPrint class's format specifiers.      
           A number can be inserted in front of the "i" to specify the total length of the input field.    
                                                                                                            
         * "%{fieldname}m" reads the value of a meteorological field at the Parcel's location and time.     
           Since such a meteorological field value is not part of the Parcel's internal state, this value   
           is discarded. This code exists for compatibility with the StreamPrint class's format specifiers. 
           A number can be inserted in front of the "{" to specify the total length of the input field.     
           If two numbers separated by a period are inserted, the first is an overall length                
           and the second is the number of decimal places. A "-" inserted just after the "%" is ignored.    
          
          * "%c" reads and discards characters. 
             A number can be inserted in front of the "c" to specify the total length of the input field. 
             If the width is specified, then that many characters are read from the input and discarded.
             Otherwise, characters are read and discarded until either white space, a number, or the end of the line
             is encountered; numbers begin with a digit "0"-"9", a sign ("+" or "-"), or a decimal point (".").    
          
          * "%x" reads and discards characters. 
             A number can be inserted in front of the "x" to specify the total length of the input field. 
             If the width is specified, then that many characters are read from the input and discarded.
             Otherwise, characters (including white space) are read and discarded until a number
             or the end of line is encountered; numbers begin with a digit "0"-"9", a sign ("+" or "-"), or a decimal point (".").    
          
          For example, suppose a parcel to be traced isentropically is to be initialized from
          an input text string "Time: 2012-03-12T15:10:33 (       12.3455), Position (-40.56 ,24.335,457.00)".
          The format "Time: %T (%14.5t), Position (%-7.2o, %-6.2a, %v)" may be used, The Parcel's time
          will be set to the internal model time that corresponds to "2012-03-12T15:10:33" in the Gregorian
          calendar, then that time will be overwritten by the internal model time 12.3455.
          The Parcel's latitude is set to 24.335, its longitude to -40.56, and its vertical coordinate
          (presumably potential temperature) set to 457.00.
          
          Note that if the format string contains a newline character ("\n"), the format string is
          considered to end wth the previous character, after all subsequent characters are
          discarded.  Also, whitespace is not equivalent: spaces are considered different characters 
          from tabs.
          
          When a StreamRead object reads from the input stream using a format specification string,
          be aware that any parcel attributes not specified in the format string will be left
          unaltered. Also, the input stream is read in line by line, so that any portion of
          an input line beyond the last piece of information specified by the format string,
          is discarded. 
          
          \param fmtstr the format string. If the string is empty (""), then the default format is used.
