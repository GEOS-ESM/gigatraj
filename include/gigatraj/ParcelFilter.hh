\brief filters that create, initialize, destroy, report on, or otherwise deal with Parcels

This is a superclass from which every class that manipulates Parcel objects inherits.
Any object that creates or destroys Parcels, or which alters their state in some
what that is either impossible or inappropriate for the Parcels to do for themselves,
is a member of the ParcelFilter class.

\ingroup parcelfilters

\brief an abstract class for operating on parcels

\details

The ParcelFilter class is an abstract class for performing a transformation on a collection
of Parcel objects.  This transformation may be a purely reporting function
(e.g., dumping the parcels' states to a file), or it may set parcels' states (e.g.,
a Parcel initializer). A ParcelFilter may be a source of Parcels (i.e., a member of
the ParcelGenerator class), or a sink for Parcels.
