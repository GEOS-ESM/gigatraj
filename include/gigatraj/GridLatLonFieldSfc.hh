\brief class for a gridded lat-lon meteorological field data
on a two-dimensional quasi-horizontal surface

\ingroup gridsfc

The GridLatLonFieldSfc class provides a way of holding in one object all of the
information that is needed to use meteorological data on a quasi-horizontal surface,
where the data are represented as a two-dimensional grid of numbers,
the first dimension being longitude and and the second being latitude.

A subclass of the more general GridFieldSfc, GridLatLonFieldSfc has its two
dimensions (longitude and latitude) independent of each other.  The data field
may therefore be thought of as a two-dimensional array which is indexed by
longitude and latitude.
