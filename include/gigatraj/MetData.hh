\brief abstract class for a source of meteorological field data

The MetData class is an abstract class.
An object of this class provides meteorological data at parcel locations.
This is used not only to obtain the winds for tracing the trjectories,
but also to get other meteorological variables for other purposes
(e.g., temperature for determining the minimum temperature a parcel 
has encountered).

Different sources of meteorological data may use different calendar 
systems.  Although most real-life products are expressed in terms of
the Gregorian calendar, model-generated fields may be on a constant 365-day
year (i.e., no leap years, ever) or even a 360-day year.  Thus, the
process of translating between model time and calendar time is
assigned to this object. This abstract method defines means of
translating between the calendar system used byu the data source,
and internal model time.

Different source of meteorological data may also use different 
forms of data (arrays of gridpoints, spherical harmonic coefficients, 
and so on). This abstract class assumes nothing about the form of the data.
It defines means of obtaining values of meteorological fields at 
specific points in space at specific times.

In a parallel processing environment, the available processors may be 
organized into groups, with a processor in each group dedicated to
handing the meteorological data. This may be useful, for example,
if gridded data fiuelds require very large amounts of memory.
In those environments, a MetData object 
will hide such organization, appearing to the user to simply return the
data values needed, when in actuality the parcel-tracing processors
are requesting and receiving data values from the dedicated
meteorological processor. This abstract class defines
methods that implement this ability,
