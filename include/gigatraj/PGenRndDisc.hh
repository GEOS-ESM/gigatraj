\brief generates collections of parcels uniformly distributed in a disc

The PGenRndDisc class generates collections of parcels that are 
randomly distributed horizontally within a disc of a given radius and thickness,
centered on a given longitude and latitude.
The distribution of points takes into account the convergence
of longitude lines at the pole.

Aside from the horizontal and vertical positions, all other characteristics
of the Parcels are copied from an input parcel.
