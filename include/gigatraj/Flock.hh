/*!  \ingroup parcels

\brief parallelizable collection of Parcels.  

The Flock class is a container class that holds Parcels.
It is iterable, and it also accomodates parallel processing
in a way that is transparent to the user.

The idea is that you would put your Parcels into a Flock,
and then iterate over the member Parcels of the Flock to carry 
out some kind of operation on each one, such as tracing its
trajectory or retrieving meteorological field values
at its location.

In a serial processing environment, this would be straighforward
to implement with any generic C++ container class, or even with
a simple array of parcels.  But in a parallel processing environment,
things are not so simple.  We certainly would not want every 
processor to apply an operation to every parcel; rather, we 
want to divide up the Parcels among the processors, with each processor
handling its share.  It would be good to do this automatically
somehow as well, with no explicit calls to inter-process communication
routines to clutter up the science logic of the program.
Moreover, in some situations such as file input,
we want an operation carried out on the rank-0 "root" processor 
and then hand the resulting parcel off to one of the processors.
Or conversely, we want the root processor to obtain each parcel
from the various processors and conduct some operation on it 
such as file output.

The Flock class provides these capabilities.  Using the 
parallel-processing abilities that have been abstracted into
the ProcessGrp class, the Flock class automatically assigns Parcels
to available processors.  An iterator is provided that lets each processor
loop in parallel through its share of the Parcels only.  Special class methods
exist as well to permit centralized serial processing of each Parcel.

In addition, the Flock can set some processors aside for
handling meteorological data instead of tracing trajectories.
This can be useful when you do not wish to hold a copies of 
large, high-resolution arrays of met data in every processor.
Instead, some number of processors hold the met data, 
and the tracing processors communicate with the met processors
to get their wind values.  Again, this should work transparently
with no additional programming effort required.  The Flock simply 
takes care of it.

Thus, the Flock class enables a programmer to 
write a custom massively-parallel trajectory model 
in a straighforward way, without having to worry (much)
about the mechanics of communication between parallel
processors.

     \brief iterator for the Flock class.

     The iterator for this Parcel container class.

     In a serial-processing environment this class functions
     as a conventional iterator, cycling through every Parcel in the
     Flock. But in a parallel-processing environment, this class
     runs on each processor in such a way that it
     iterates only over the Parcels within the flock that are assigned to
     that processor.
     
     In other words, when multiprocessing this iterator is used to access only those parcels
     that belong to the current process. Thus, when a Flock
     is being processed across multiple processors, each
     processor is iterating over its own parcels only, 
     but from the viewpoint of the programmer it appears
     to be iteratating over all parcels in the flock.  The multi-processing
     aspect of the loop becomes a negligible detail.
     
     If some of the processors are dedicated to reading meteorological data,
     they must not try to trace parcels inside the loop.  This, too, is
     handled automatically.  See the Flock::begin() and Flock::end() methods,
     below.
