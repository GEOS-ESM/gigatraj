\ingroup MetSrc
\brief class for reading the GEOS data products from local files.

This class implements access to local files of products output by
the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) pf
the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) of
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. 

It requires a configuration file, used by a Catalog object, The confLocator string to use is "MyGEOSCatalog".

           will succeed. You need want to try multiple times
           before the operation succeeds.
           
           This function takes two arguments. The first, "error", is
           compared to the netcdf library's NC_NOERR value.
           If it is equal to NO_NOERR, then false is returned.
           Otherwise, we consider that an error has occurred and we must decide
           whether to re-try the operation.

           this object's ntries element. If lesz than ntries,
           the function will wait for the number of seconds in 
           (waittry*trial) seconds and then return true.
