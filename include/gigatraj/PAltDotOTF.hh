\brief class for computing the total time derivative of pressure altitude from other meteorological data fields


\details

\details

The PAltDotOTF class provides GridField3D objects full of
the total time derivative of pressure altitude. This is not
exactly the same as the vertical wind, or "w", as those
that quantity is the total time derivative of geometric altitude.
But the two should be similar.

Sources of gridded meteorological fields seldom provide "w", 
much less the time rate of change of pressure altitude.
Nevertheless, this is a critical quantity to have when running
trajectories in pressure-altitude coordinates, since it is the rate of
change of the parcel's vertical coordinate.  
Since the pressure altitude tendency is easily calculated
from other quantities that are commonly provided (notably the
pressure tendency omega), the PAltDotOTF class
ensures that PAlt-Dot is always available from a given meteorological
source.

It is intended that this class be used by implementers of new
subclasses of MetGridData, to satisfy users' requests 
when the original data source does not provide the requested fields explicitly.
Note that the calc() methods of this class take fields of the
GridField3D virtual class as input parameters and produce a new
GridField3D object as output.  Objects of any single subclass of GridField3D
may be used as inputs, so long as they are grid-compatible with each other,
and the return value will be of the same
subclass of GridField3D as the inputs.  However, the calling routine will
need to do a dynamic cast from GridField3D to the particular
subclass being used.

Users should obtain their pressure altitude tendency fields by requesting them
from a MetGridData subclass such as MetMERRA, rather than by
reading other fields and giving them to PAltDotOTF.
