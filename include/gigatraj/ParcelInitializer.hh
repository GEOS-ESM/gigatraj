\brief an abstract base class for loading state into Parcels

The ParcelInitializer class is an abstract class for loading state information into a Parcel
object or collection of Parcel objects.  Note that an
object of this class does not create new Parcel objects;
the Parcel or collection of Parcels must already
exist.
