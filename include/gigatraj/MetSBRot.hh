\brief provides tilted solid-body rotation winds as fake meteorological fields

The MetSBRot class provides fake meteorological data at parcel locations
for use in testing and debiugging the gigatraj model.  The winds are solid-body
rotation winds.  (Note that the axis of wind rotation can be tilted from the
earth's axis.) Other meteorological fields are purely artificial and are *not*
constructed to be consistent with the winds.

Time is a calendarless system, simply the string encoding of the model time in days.

Meteorological fields do NOT follow the UCAR CF naming conventions, but are as follows:
 -               zonal wind = "u"
 -          meridional wind = "v"
 -            vertical wind = "w"
 -              temperature = "t"
 -    potential temperature = "theta"
 -                 pressure = "p"
 -                  density = "rho"
 -      geopotential height = "z"
 -      (pressure) altitude = "alt"
 -         net heating rate = "heating rate"
 -  local pressure tendency = "omega"
