\brief abstract class for a gridded meteorological field 

The MetGridData class is an abstract class.
An object of this class provides a two- or three-dimensional grid 
of meteorological data which is valid for a given time.
There are no presuppositions made about the kind of grid the data are on.
It might possibly be irregular, or on some sort of triangular 
mesh rather than a strict rectangular grid. The GridField class
provides that which is common to all conceivable gridded data fields.

There are two child classes of this class, both of them abstract as well:
GridFieldSfc holds two-dimensional data on quasi-horizontal surfaces, such
as tropopause temperatures.
GridField3D holds three-dimensional data, in which the third dimension is
vertical and is independent of the two horizontal dimensions; think of it
as a stack of GridFieldSfc objects.

         The meteorological data are valid at a particular time.
         The gigatraj model uses an internal time which is a double precision
         floating-point number.  The meteorological data sources
         will use some string label to denote the valid-at time; this
         is usually an ISO-format date+time string in the Gregorian

         calendar time is arbitrary and is handled elsewhere.
