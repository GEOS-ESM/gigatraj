\ingroup MetSrc
\brief abstract class for a gridded meteorological field data

The MetGridData class is an abstract subclass of MetData.  
An object of this class provides
meteorological data at parcel locations, when the meteorological data
comes in the form of 2D and 3D arrays (grids) of data valid at specific times.

MetGridData handles the operations which are generic across
all gridded data, such as data caching.  
Actually reading grids of data, and translating between internal model
time and external met data timestamps, must be implemented by 
the child classes.  

Note also that child classes are free to implement
their own naming conventions for physical quantities.  For example,
the zonal wind component may be "eastward_wind" as in the UCAR CF conventions,
or "U" as in common use, or even "zonal wind".  The MetData and MetGridData
abstract classes are agnostic with regard to what you call the various
met fields.  But remember that many of the Filter class objects might
not be: a Filter that determines whether a parcel is above or below
the tropopause, for example, might easily be hard-coded to look for  
"tropopause_air_pressure" or "TropP" or "TPRS".  It is to be hoped that
most Filters will be written in a more generic and flexible way,
but there are no guarantees.

In addition to the implementing the virtual methods listed here, 
any class which inherits
the MetGridData class must do the follinwg:

1) If the naming convention for physical quantities does not
   follow the UCAR CF naming conventions, then the class must 
   set the wind_vert_name, wind_ew_name, and wind_ns_name variables
   in its constructor, as well as delete us,vs, and wd, then
   create new MetCache3D variables for these which are initialized
   with the new names.

2) It must implement the set_vertical() method, using the 
   chosen naming conventions to set the name of the vertical wind
   based on the name of the chosen vertical coordinate.

3) It must implement the new_directGrid3D() and new_directGridSfc()
   methods.
   These are the routines that will actually 
   acquire the gridded met data
   from some external source (reading from a file, querying an OPeNDAP 
   server, etc.).

   In the most common cases of new MetGridData implementations,
   these will return GridLatLonField3D and GridLatLonFieldSfc objects, respectively.
   But if your new data source uses met data that are not on a simple
   longitude-latitude grid, then you will need to find or implement 
   new child classes of GridField3D and GridFieldSfc, add 
   new methods that will operate on these grids to the horizontal 
   (hinterp) and vertical (vinterp) interpolator classes, and then
   have your new_directGrid3D and new_directGridSfc methods here return those new
   grid objects.
