  \brief Holds a three-dimensional grid of meteorological data
  
  These clases define objects that hold meteorological fields
  that are defined in three spatial dimensions (two horizontla and one vertical).

/*!
\brief abstract class for a three-dimensional gridded meteorological 
data field, in which the third dimension is a vertical coordinate
which is independent of the two horizontal coordinates.

\ingroup grid3D

The GridField3D class provides a way of holding in one object all of the
information that is needed to deal with such data.

Although the most obvious horizontal grid structure is a simple rectangular
longitude-latitude grid, other possibilities exist as well.  
For example, the two horizontal 
data grid coordinates could be map coordinates whose relation to 
longitude and latitude is non-trivial.  In that case, longitude and latitude
would each be represented by a 2D grid of map coordinates inctead of a single
vector.

See the GridLatLonGrid3D class for the simple longitude-latitude-vertical grid.
