\brief class for computing pressure from other meteorological data fields

\details

The PressOTF class provides GridField3D and GridFieldSfc objects full of
air pressure values.  

Sources of gridded meteorological fields seldom provide air pressure
as one of their products, except on a few specific surfaces, 
since their products are usually given on isobaric surfaces.
Nevertheless, pressure can be a very useful 
quantity in its own right, especially when products have
been interpolated to new vertical coordinate systems.  
Since pressure is easily calculated
from other quantities that are commonly provided, the PressOTF class
ensures that pressure is always available from a given meteorological
source.

It is intended that this class be used by implementers of new
subclasses of MetGridData, to satisfy users' requests air pressure data
when the original data source does not provide such fields explicitly.
Note that the calc() methods of this class take fields of the
GridField3D or GridFieldSfc virtual classes as input parameters and produce a new
GridField3D or GridFieldSfc object as output.  Objects of any single subclass 
of GridField3D/GridFieldSfc
may be used as inputs, so long as they are grid-compatible with each other,
and the return value will be of the same
subclass of GridField3D/GridFieldSfc as the inputs.  However, the calling routine will
need to do a dynamic cast from GridField3D or GridfieldSfc to the particular
subclass being used.

Users should obtain their air pressure fields by requesting them
from a MetGridData subclass such as MetMERRA, rather than by
reading other fields and giving them to PressOTF.
