\ingroup parcelinitializers

\brief loads Parcel state information from a netcdf file that follows certain conventions.

The NetcdfIn class reads information about Parcels from a netcdf4 file.
The file must have at least one dimensional variable: an integer parcel ID number, 
called "parcelID". (The information in this variable is not actually used.)
The file must also have data variables "lon" and "lat".
If must also have at least one variable with the "positive" attribute, which
denotes a vertical level. There should be one of these variables
with the attribute :"vertical _coordinate", and that attribute should
be set to "yes". That data varibale is taken as the vertical cooridnate
of the Parcels.

The file may have a second dimensional variable, "time". If so, then each of 
the file's data variables is a 2D variable. By default, Parcels from the first 
timestep (not necessarily the earliest in time, but the zeroeth element of the
time array) is used.

          calling the readTag(), readStatus(), and readFlags() methods.
          
          The format string is the same as used by StreamRead, but it does behave differently.
          %-codes merely turn on and off the reading of variables, with string literals and numeric 
          precision specifiers ignored. The model time, longitude, latitude, and vertical coordinate 
          are all mandatory for gigatraj netcdf files, so they will be written out regardless of whether
          they are specified in the format string.

          * "%T" is tignored
          
          * "%t" is the parcel's model time, This is effectively ignored, as the time is read regardless of
            whether this is present or not.
          
          * "%o" is the parcel's longitude. This is effectively ignored, as the longitude is read
             regardless of whether this is present or not.
             
          * "%a" is the parcel's latitude. This is effectively ignored, as the latitude is read
             regardless of whether this is present or not.
             
          * "%v" is the parcel's vertical coordinate. This is effectively ignored, as the the vertical coordinate is read
             regardless of whether this is present or not.
          
          * "%g" causes the parcel's  tag value to be read from the file in the variable "tag".
          
          * "%f" causes the parcel's flags to be read from the variable "flags".
          
          * "%s" causes the parcel's status to be read from the variable "status".
