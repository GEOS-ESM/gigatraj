\brief writes Parcel information to a netcdf file

The NetcdfOut class writes parcel information to a netcdf file.

It has a counterpart for input, the NetcdfIn class.

            whether this is present or not.
          
          * "%o" is the parcel's longitude. This is effectively ignored, as the longitude is output
             regardless of whether this is presetn or not.

             regardless of whether this is presetn or not.
