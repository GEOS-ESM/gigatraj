\brief chnages the vertical cooridnate of a parcel from one physical quantity to another

The ChangeVertical class switches a parcel's vertical coordinate from one vertical quantity to another.
Using and object of this class, a parcel may be initialized in, say, pressure altitude and
converted to potential temperature for tracing in quasi-isentropic mode and subsequent conversion 
and output back to pressure altitudes.
