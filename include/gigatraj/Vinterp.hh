\brief abstract class for interpolating one or more vertical profiles to a specific vertical level

The Vinterp class is an abstract class.
An object of this class provides a means of interpolating a field on 
one or more vertical profiles
to specific vertical levels within those profiles.

The vertical profile at each horizontal gridpoint being interpolated 
should be monotonic.  This condition might
not be strictly satisfied at the lowest altitudes; only the topmost part of each profile
that is monotonic is used. 

The various interpolation methods of this class take an optional \p flags 
paremeter.  The flag constant values, which have names of the form GT_*, 
are defined in the gigatraj namespace.
