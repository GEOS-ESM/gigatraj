\brief an abstract class for extracting state from Parcels

The ParcelReporter class is an abstract class for extracting state information from
a Parcel object or a collection of Parcel objects. 
The basic idea is that the Parcel states are left unchanged, but the information
gained is used to some purpose.
The purpose may be almost
anything, from a creating a written file dump of each parcel's state,
to a computing a single statistic compiled from the ensemble of all parcels.
