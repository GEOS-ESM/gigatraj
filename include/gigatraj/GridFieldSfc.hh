\brief abstract class for a gridded meteorological data field
on a two-dimensional quasi-horizontal surface.

 \ingroup gridsfc

The GridFieldSfc class provides a way of holding in one object all of the
information that is needed to deal with such data.

Although the most obvious horizontal grid structure is a simple rectangular
longitude-latitude grid, other possibilities exist as well.  
For example, the two horizontal 
data grid coordinates could be map coordinates whose relation to 
longitude and latitude is non-trivial.  In that case, longitude and latitude
would each be represented by a 2D grid of map coordinates inctead of a single
vector.

See the GridLatLonGridSFC class for the simple longitude-latitude grid.
