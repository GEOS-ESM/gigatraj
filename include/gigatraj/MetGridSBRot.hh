\brief class for a gridded version of the tilted solid-body rotation meteorological field data source

The MetGridSBRot class provides a source of meteorological data
derived from three-dimensional grids (longitude, latitude,
vertical-coordinate) of tilted solid-body rotation winds.
This class is meant for testing the gigatraj model.  

While the MetSBRot class provides meteorological field values that are 
evaluated directly from analytic functions, this class
evaluates those functions only at discrete points on a grid.
Values provided to calling routines in gigatraj are obtained
by interpolation from the grid.  In this way, we can perform
experiments to separate integration errors from interpolation errors.

In order to test the ability of the Grid-handling functions to handle
different naming conventions, this class does not use the UCAR CF conventions.
See the MetSBRot class for information on met field naming conventions
(which are not UCAR CF) and time-calendar equivalence.

Surfaces are named this way:  
 -  "sfc" = surface
 - "trop" = tropopause
