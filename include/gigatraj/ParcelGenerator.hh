\brief a base class for generating collections of Parcels

The ParcelGenerator class is a base class for creating collections of Parcel objects.
If the methods of this base class are called, the Parcels created will be uninitialized.
Various subclasses that inherit from ParcelGenerator may create Parcels which are 
initialized in various ways: distributed randomly,
or read from a file, or on a regularly-spaced grid. The functionality that those subclasses
have in common, is found here.
