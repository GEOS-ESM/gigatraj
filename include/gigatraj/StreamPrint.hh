\brief prints Parcel state information to an ostream

The StreamPrint class prints out parcel information, in human-readable form, to an ostream.

It has a counterpart for input, the StreamRead class.

      /// set the format for how a parcel is to be printed
      /*! This method allows the user to specify the format in which a parcel's information is to be printed.
          The specification takes the form of a string with the following format:
          
          * Any text up to a "%" character is copied to the output verbatim.
          
          * "%%" appears as "%" in the output
          
          * "%T" inserts the  parcel's time, after conversion to a (MetData-source-specific) Calendar time string,
            into the output. A number inserted before the "T" (e.g., "%4T") is used as the length of the output, 
            starting with the zeroeth character by default. If two numbers, separated by a period, are inserted
            before the "T", the first number is the starting character to extract from the character string,
            and the second number is the number of characters to extract. for example, if the calendar string is 
            "2017-03-14T14:35:15", then "%5.8T" will results in "03-14T14" being inserted into the output.
            (Note that the "14:35:15" is not rounded to "15". StreamPrint knows nothing about the semantics
            of the calendar string.) If a minus sign is inserted just after the "%", then the output
            is left-aligned; the default is right alignment (i.e., leading spaces).
      
         * "%t" inserts the parcel's time, as internal model time (not converted to a calendar time).
           A number can be inserted in front of the "t" to specify the total length of the output.
           If two numbers separated by a period are inserted, the first is an overall length
           and the second is the number of decimal places. A "-" inserted just after the "%" indicates
           left-alignment.
          
         * "%o" inserts the parcel's longitude, in numeric form positive east.
           A number can be inserted in front of the "o" to specify the total length of the output.
           If two numbers separated by a period are inserted, the first is an overall length
           and the second is the number of decimal places. A "-" inserted just after the "%" indicates
           left-alignment.
          
         * "%a" inserts the parcel's latitude, in numeric form positive north.
           A number can be inserted in front of the "a" to specify the total length of the output.
           If two numbers separated by a period are inserted, the first is an overall length
           and the second is the number of decimal places. A "-" inserted just after the "%" indicates
           left-alignment.
          
         * "%v" inserts the parcel's vertical coordinate, according to the coordinate system being
           used to trace the parcels.
           A number can be inserted in front of the "v" to specify the total length of the output.
           If two numbers separated by a period are inserted, the first is an overall length
           and the second is the number of decimal places. A "-" inserted just after the "%" indicates
           left-alignment.
          
         * "%g" inserts the parcel's tag value.
           A number can be inserted in front of the "g" to specify the total length of the output.
           If two numbers separated by a period are inserted, the first is an overall length
           and the second is the number of decimal places. A "-" inserted just after the "%" indicates
           left-alignment.
          
          * "%f" inserts the parcel's flags. A number can be inserted in front of the "f" to
            specify the total length of the output.
          
          * "%s" inserts the parcel's status code. A number can be inserted in front of the "s" to
            specify the total length of the output.
          
          * "%i" inserts the parcel's index number. For single parcels, the index is zero. For Arrays, 
            vectors, lists, deques, and flocks of parcels, this is the element number within
            the collection of parcels. (Note that as these collections are manipulated, the index
            number of an individual parcel may change.) A number can be inserted in front of the "i" to
            specify the total length of the output.
          
          * "%{fieldname}m" inserts the value of a meteorological field at the Parcel's location and time.
            By default, the Parcel's meteorological data source is sued to obtain the field value,
            but the setMetSRC() method may be used to specify an alternate data source.
            Note that the process of reading and interpolating data is likely to slow the model down
            significantly; you will probably want to use this specifier sparingly.
            A number can be inserted in front of the "{" to specify the total length of the output.
            If two numbers separated by a period are inserted, the first is an overall length
            and the second is the number of decimal places. A "-" inserted just after the "%" indicates
            left-alignment.

          * "%c" prints out a sequence of "c" characters. 
             A number can be inserted in front of the "c" to specify the total length of the output field. 
             Otherwise just one "c" is printed. This code is included for compatibility with the StreamRead class's
             format specifications.    
          
          * "%x" prints out a sequence of "x" characters. 
             A number can be inserted in front of the "x" to specify the total length of the output field. 
             Otherwise just one "x" is printed. This code is included for compatibility with the StreamRead class's
             format specifications.    
          
          
          For example, suppose a parcel being traced isentropically 
          is at internal model time 12.3455, corresponding to calendar
          time "2012-03-12T15:10:33" i the Gregorian calendar, and is at position 40.56 west longitude,
          24.334546 north latitude, at 457 K potential temperature.
          The format "Time: %T (%14.5t), Position (%-7.2o, %-6.2a, %v)" will
          insert into the stream the string 
          "Time: 2012-03-12T15:10:33 (       12.3455), Position (-40.56 ,24.335,457.00)"
          
          \param fmtstr the format string. Most often, the format string should end with "\n", so that
                     each parcel's information will appear on a separate line from the others.
