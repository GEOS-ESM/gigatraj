/*!  \defgroup pgroup  Process Groups

The gigatraj model may be used for either serial or parallel processing.
We assume that the computer system on which the model is run consists
of one or more independent processors.  The task of tracing parcel trajectories
is distributed among theses processors.  Because many meteorological data sets
are of high spatial resolution and thus require much memory, gigatraj
also allows some processors to be dedicated to handing these data, in order
to reduce the memory required by a model run.

The processors available for a model run are divided up into
groups.  Each processor in a group may take on one or more of three
possible roles:  tracing trajectories, handling meteorological data, and
coordinating processors.  (Within a group, at most one processor can take on
that last duty.)  Processor groups may be split into subgroups, each of which then
has a coordinating processes.   Data of various types may be exchanged
between processors

The Process Groups classes provide
a uniform interface for dealing with these processor management and communication functions.

\ingroup pgroup
\brief an abstract class for managing process groups

The ProcessGrp class serves
as the abstract class upon which an interface is defined for dealing with
(i.e. defining and communicating within) groups of processors.

The underlying model is that there exists a collection of processors.  
These may be divided into groups which can then be set to work on
various tasks.  There is a default group to which all the processors
belong initially.  Each group has a "root" processor; the root can tell the other
processors what to do, and it can divide them up into groups.
Every processor has a role assigned to it.  The root processor has the role
of Coordinator.  Of course another key role is to trace parcel
trajectories: the Tracer role.  The Flock class, which holds a collection of parcels, 
knows about process groups and automatically divides its parcels up among the available 
Tracer processors. Similarly for the Swarm class, which appears to hold Parcels (but stores
the information dfferently internally).
In some cases, the meteorological data source consists of
large data arrays of such fine resolution
that the cost is prohibitive for each processor to hold its own copy of the grids in memory.
Thus, another processor role has been defined to handle these cases: the MetReader.
MetReader processors are dedicated to reading gridded meteorological data.  When a
Tracer processor needs to interpolate a field, it sends its desired grid indices
to a met processor, which returns the field values at those grid points.  The
Tracer processor then uses those values in the interpolation calculation.
In some implementations, this division of labor imposes a 
penalty in the form of a vastly increased
number of messages passing back and forth between processors, so it should be used only
when needed.  A processor may therefore have the role of Tracer, MetReader, Coordinator,
or All (which performs all of the roles).

Each program should have exactly one object of a ProcessGrp subclass.  In a parallel
processing environment, this object will contain all of the information needed
to distinguish one processor from another, to determine processor roles, and to
facilitiate inter-processor communication.  
Consequently, an object of a ProcessGrp subclass will be instantiated differently 
on different processors.   After creating ProcessGrp object, the calling code should 
have the object
query itself to find out what its role is and then take appropriate action
depending on that role.  In serial environments, the ProcessGrp object
will actually do very little.  But having it enables the library to handle both
the serial and parallel cases.
