   \brief Catalog implements a catalog of files of meteorological data to be opened
   
   \details
   
The Catalog class provides a way for MetData objects which rely on reading files 
or URLs to map data requests to specific URLs.  A data request consists of 
the name of a physical quantity, a Gregorian calendar date-time string
(in 'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss' format, as in ISO8601) at which vallid data are desired, and (optionally) an
arbitrary confLocator string (typically used to indictate a forecast model run).
The Catalog's response to the request is a vector of objects, each of which
has the name of a file containing the data just before or at the date-time string,
the name of a file containing the data at the next time snapshot after the date-time string,
and various attributes and characteristics of the data that would be read from those
files: units, resolution, vertical coordinate, etc.

Why is a Catalog class needed? For data that are read from a central network server (such as an OPeNDAP), this
mapping can be hard-coded into a MetData object, with little need for a Catalog. 
But for data that are read from local files, we find that local sites often set up their own conventions for organizing
data sets, instead of following the conventions used by the original data source.
If gigatraj is to be useful, then some class is needed that can do the
mapping based on local site- or user-specific configurations.

In use, the Catalog will load a configuration from a file that 
essentially specifies which data are to be found in which files.
Then, as the MetData object queries the Catalog for a specific
physical quantity at a specific time in the Gregorian calendar, 
The "pre" and "post" filenames returned can be opened to read the data, their resepctive valid-at
times can be used for time interpolation, and the target attributes can be used to 
decide what other manipulations of the data should be applied.
And because the filenames are taken form a vector of objects, 
the MetData object can open each set of files in turn, until it successfully
reads the desired data. In this way one can for exmaple specify that
analysis data are to be read first, or forecast data if there are no analysis data yet.
Thus the Catalog class is of use to people who are implementing new MetData subclasses.
But understanding how Catalog works and how to configure it will be useful to
those who seek to adapt an existing MetData subclass to their own local file
organizational conventions.

The configuration file lists each physical quantity that should be readable by gigatraj.
Associated with ewach quantity is a list of "Targets" from which the data may be read.
Each Target represents a unique addressable entity such as a file. But of course file names
often contain such things as dates and quantity codes, so the 
Targets work by interpolating string values into the filename template, using varibale references.
For example, if the Target named "targ01" has the template "${QUANTITY}_$YEAR}${MONTH}${DOM}${HOUR}_${TABLE}.dat",
it will substitute values for QUANTITY, YEAR, MONTH, DOM (day-of-month), HOUr, and TABLE in the template,
returning a value such as "T_2021071518_MET.dat". In addition, each Target contains information
about the time spacing of the data a filCe contains, as well as a set of named attributes
that can be used for descriptions of such things as the file's horizontal resolution, vertical coordinate,
time averaging, and so on.

Where do the values of these varDensOTF.cciable references come from? Some of them are defined
automatically:

  * QUANTITY = the name of the quantity being requested
  * DATETIME = the full "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss" date string fo rthe valid-at time snapshot
  * DATE = the "yyyy-mm-dd" date string for the valid-at time snapshot
  * TIME = the "hh:mm:ss" time string for the valid-at time snapshot
  * YEAR = the 4-digit year (e.g., 1997) from the valid-at time snapshot
  * CN = the 2-digit century (e.g., 19) from the valid-at time snapshot
  * YR = the 2-digit year of the century (e.g, 97) from the valid-at time snapshot
  * MONTH = the 2-digit number of the month (01-12) from the valid-at time snapshot
  * DOM = the 2-digit day of the month (01-31) from the valid-at time snapshot
  * DOY = the 3-digit day of the year (001-366) from the valid-at time snapshot
  * HOUR = the 2-digit hour from the valid-at time snapshot
  * MINUTE = the 2-digit minute from the valid-at time snapshot
  * SECOND = the 2-digit second  from the valid-at time snapshot
  * TAG = the optional tag supplied to the query() method

In addition to these, other variables may be defined within the
configuration file (see below).

If a variable is not defined either automatically or explicitly in the configuration,
then the Target's attributes are inspected. If an attribute is found with the same
name as the variable reference, then that Target attribute is used as the variable value.

If no variable or Target attribute is found that matches the variable reference, then the user's
runtime environment is consulted. A shell environment variable with the requested name
will have its value interpolated into the template.

Variables are values or expressions that can be referecned by name.
The Catalog configuration file allows for five types of variables:
strings, booleans, integers, floating-point numbers, and dates.
A variable's value may be a literal of the correct type, or it
may be an expression to be evaluated when a data query is made.
A variable may be defined conditionally, so that it is assigned
a specified value only if specified conditions apply. The conditions
are expressed as a boolean logical expression that evaluates to either
true or false. Multiple variable definitions may be defined (all of the same 
data type!), and when a data request is made the definitions will
be examined in the same order as they are found in the configuration file.
The first definition whose conditional expression evaluates as true, will
be the definition that is assigned to the variable.


The configuration file syntax:

The configuration file is a plain text file. Blank lines and comment lines (lines that consist of optional whitespace
followed by "#") will be ignored.

Identifiers consist of a leading alphabetic character ("A"-"Z" and "a"-"z"), followed
by zero or more alphabetic characters, numeric digits ("0"-"9"), or underscores ("_").

Aside from multiple definitons of the same variable, the lines of a configuration
file may be arranged in any order.

There should be exactly one line that names the attributes used by the Targets. That line
will begin with a ";" character, followed by one or more attribute identifiers.
All Targets must have the same number of attribute values as the number of attribute names given here.
an example of such a line might be:
\code
; horiz ; vert ; tavg 
\endcode

The MetData class that uses Catalog is responsible for
the symantics of these attributes; Catalog merely
handles the syntax.

For each physical quantity that gigatraj should be able to read,  there must be a line
of the form "quantity : standard_name : target1 | target2 | target3 | ..."; this lines tells the Catalog which
Targets can supply the desired quantity. (The standard_name is a standardized name for people who are unfamiliar with
the data set's own naming convention; UCAR's "CF" naming convention is a good one to use here.)
Each Target in the "|"-separated list may be prceeded
by one or two clauses enclosed in pairs of brackets ("[" and "]"). The first (or onlyu) such
clause specifies information about units. Ideally, this information is read from the file,
but that is not always possible. The units information consists of a string giving the units
of the quantity, optionaly collowed by a ":" and a scale factor that can convert the quantity
as read from the file to MKS units, optionally followed by another ";" and an offset to be used in the
conversion to MKS units. Thus, "[K]" specifies the units of Kelvin (for temperature), while
"[F; 0.55556; 255.372]" specifies units of degrees Fahrenheit, which can be converted to Kelvin
by multiplying by 0.55556 and adding 255.372. The second pair of brackets, if given, specify
a description of that data variable: for example, "[air_temperature]".
The order of Targets in the "|"-separated list should be in their order of preference for
that physical quantity; typically this hsould be the order that requires less work
in units conversion, or horizontal regridding, or vertical regridding. The Target order can also
indicate the preference for analysis products over forecast model output. An example
might look like this:
\code
T : [K]targ1 | [C ; 1.0 ; 273.15]targ2
\endcode

If the scale factor is given without an offset,
then the offset is considered  to be zero. If no scale factor
is specified, then the conversion is undefined in the Catalog
and must be hard-coded in the MetData class that uses the Catalog.
           
Each Target that is referenced by a quantity line must be defined by a configuration line of the form:
"identifier := base-hour; inc-hour; attribute-value-1; attribute-value-2; ... ; filename-template".
the "identifier" is the name of the Target. The base-hour is the hour of the first time snapshot 
to be found in the file. The inc-hour is the spacing of time snapshots in the file.
These are followed by attribute values that correspond to the attribute names given
by the line that starts with ";". These are followed by the filename template. For example, 
a file that holds data for a single data, starting at 00Z and spaced 3 hours apart, with
a horizontal resolution of 1 by 1 degree, in pressure coordinates, and being non-averaged instantaneous
data, might look like this:
\code
 targ1 := 0.0 ; 3.0; 1X1 ; pres ; inst ; ${QUANTITY}_${YEAR}${MONTH}${DOM}_${FOO}.dat
\endcode


As mentioned above, some variables such as "QUANTITY" and "YEAR" are defined automatically
when a request is made. Others, such as "FOO" in our example, need to be defined in the configuration file.
A variable definition line may take the form "identifier/type = expression" or "identifier/type = logical-expression ? expression".
The identifier names the variable.
The type may be "S" (for string), "B" (for boolean), "I" (for integer),
"F" (for float), or "D" (for date).  If the variable is of type string, the "/S" may be omitted.
The expressions may be simple literal values, or they may be 
complicated arithmetic expressions. (If the type of the expression is not right, it will
be converted to the proper type when it is evaluated.)  
Multiple connfiguration lines may define a single variable. The definitions are evaluated
in order, and the first definition whose test expression evaluates to "true" will be used.
Examples of variable definitions might be:
\code
FOO/S = ${DATE} >= [2000-01-01] ? "New"
FOO/S = "Old"
EXAMPLE01/I = ( 125 + ${EXAMPLE02} ) *5 + ${DOY}
EXAMPLE02/I = 25
\endcode

In this example, FOO takes on the value "New" if the date of the data request is later than or equal to Jan. 1, 2000.
(Note that a date literal is enclosed in brackets, and a string literal is enclosed in quotes.); otherwise it takes
the value "Old". EXAMPLE01 is defined an an integer that depends on the separately-defined variable EXMAPLE02
and the automatically-defined DOY (the day of the year of the data request).

Note that circular definitions of variables is not permitted. You cannot define "FOO" with an expression involving "BAR" 
and then define "BAR" with an expression involving "FOO".

      /// This class holds the value of a variable
      /*! The VarVal class holds a value that can be assigned to a variable. All values associated with literals or 
          expressions are held in VarVal objects.
      
          ValVals do not have names, but they do have a type: either 'S' (string), 'B', (boolean), 'I' (integer), 'F' (float)
          or 'D' (date).
          
          A VarVal has two kinds of values associated with it. The "nominal" value is a string that holds a representation
          of the value. The "eval" value is a actual value of the correct type; this is either evalS, evalB, evalI, evalf, or evalD.
          Either the nominal value or the eval value may be set directly, and either may be converted to the other.
          There are also bitwise flags that are set to indicate which values have been set.
          If the nominal value has been set, then the ValidNominal flag is set. If an eval vlaue has been set, then the
          ValidEval flags is set.  
          
          Of course, an eval value can be set only if the value is a literal of the correct type. If the nominal
          value is set to a string that does not parse as a literal for the value's type, then the nominal
          value is not a literal and no eval value is set. Assuming the nominal value has noerrors, then 
          it will be a variable reference of the form "${name}" or (in the case of string values only) a string with
          variable references embedded within it (e.g., "red${stuff}blue".  In the former case, the evalS member
          will contain the name of the variable being referenced. In the second case, the evalS mjay be set to
          the nominal string with the variable reference values interpolated into the string.
          
          Note that the 'D' date type's evalD is a double-precision number that contains the 
          number of days elapsed since 1899-12-31T00:00:00.
          
          We use a single VarVal class definition to hold all variable types, instead of a VarVal subclass for each type,
          to make it easier to do type conversions, which we will be doing a lot.
          
          Also, the VarVal class has no facility for evaluating expressions, because it has no way
          to resolve veriable references.

          If the confLocator is specified in the constructor, then the Catalog object

          If a confLocator is given and a configuration file is found, then 
          it is read automatically.
          
          If a confLocator is given and a configuration files is not found, then an error is 
          thrown.
          
          If no confLocator is given, then the Catalog if left unconfigured. 
          Note, however, that some kind of configuration for a data set
          must be laoded into the Catalog object before it can be put
          to any practical use.
