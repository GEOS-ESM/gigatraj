\brief class for log-linearly interpolating one or more vertical profiles to a specific vertical level

An object of this class provides means of interpolating meteorological
fields in their vertical coordinates.  Interpolation is done linearly in the
log of the interpolating variable, rather than the variable itself.

The various interpolation methods of this class take an optional \c flags 
paremeter.  The flag constant values, which have names of the form GT_*, 
are defined in the gigatraj namespace.
