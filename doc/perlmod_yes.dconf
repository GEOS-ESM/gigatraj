# If the GENERATE_PERLMOD tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate a Perl module
# file that captures the structure of the code including all documentation.
#
# Note that this feature is still experimental and incomplete at the moment.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_PERLMOD       = YES

# If the PERLMOD_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate the necessary
# Makefile rules, Perl scripts and LaTeX code to be able to generate PDF and DVI
# output from the Perl module output.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_PERLMOD is set to YES.

PERLMOD_LATEX          = NO

# If the PERLMOD_PRETTY tag is set to YES, the Perl module output will be nicely
# formatted so it can be parsed by a human reader. This is useful if you want to
# understand what is going on. On the other hand, if this tag is set to NO, the
# size of the Perl module output will be much smaller and Perl will parse it
# just the same.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_PERLMOD is set to YES.

PERLMOD_PRETTY         = YES

# The names of the make variables in the generated doxyrules.make file are
# prefixed with the string contained in PERLMOD_MAKEVAR_PREFIX. This is useful
# so different doxyrules.make files included by the same Makefile don't
# overwrite each other's variables.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_PERLMOD is set to YES.
