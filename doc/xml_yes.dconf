# Configuration options related to the XML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_XML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate an XML file that
# captures the structure of the code including all documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_XML           = NO

# The XML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the XML pages will be put. If a
# relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of
# it.
# The default directory is: xml.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_OUTPUT             = xml

# If the XML_PROGRAMLISTING tag is set to YES, doxygen will dump the program
# listings (including syntax highlighting and cross-referencing information) to
# the XML output. Note that enabling this will significantly increase the size
# of the XML output.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_PROGRAMLISTING     = YES

# If the XML_NS_MEMB_FILE_SCOPE tag is set to YES, doxygen will include
# namespace members in file scope as well, matching the HTML output.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.
