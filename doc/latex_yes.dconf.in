#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
# generate Latex output.

GENERATE_LATEX         = YES

# The LATEX_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the LaTeX docs will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be 
# put in front of it. If left blank `latex' will be used as the default path.

LATEX_OUTPUT           = latex

# The LATEX_CMD_NAME tag can be used to specify the LaTeX command name to be 
# invoked. If left blank `latex' will be used as the default command name.

LATEX_CMD_NAME         = @DOX_RUN_LATEX@

# The MAKEINDEX_CMD_NAME tag can be used to specify the command name to 
# generate index for LaTeX. If left blank `makeindex' will be used as the 
# default command name.

MAKEINDEX_CMD_NAME     = @DOX_RUN_MAKEINDEX@

# If the COMPACT_LATEX tag is set to YES Doxygen generates more compact 
# LaTeX documents. This may be useful for small projects and may help to 
# save some trees in general.

COMPACT_LATEX          = NO

# The PAPER_TYPE tag can be used to set the paper type that is used 
# by the printer. Possible values are: a4, a4wide, letter, legal and 
# executive. If left blank a4wide will be used.

PAPER_TYPE             = letter

# The EXTRA_PACKAGES tag can be to specify one or more names of LaTeX 
# packages that should be included in the LaTeX output.

EXTRA_PACKAGES         = 

# The LATEX_HEADER tag can be used to specify a personal LaTeX header for 
# the generated latex document. The header should contain everything until 
# the first chapter. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a 
# standard header. Notice: only use this tag if you know what you are doing!

LATEX_HEADER           = 

# If the PDF_HYPERLINKS tag is set to YES, the LaTeX that is generated 
# is prepared for conversion to pdf (using ps2pdf). The pdf file will 
# contain links (just like the HTML output) instead of page references 
# This makes the output suitable for online browsing using a pdf viewer.

PDF_HYPERLINKS         = YES

# If the USE_PDFLATEX tag is set to YES, pdflatex will be used instead of 
# plain latex in the generated Makefile. Set this option to YES to get a 
# higher quality PDF documentation.

USE_PDFLATEX           = @DOX_PDFLATEX@

# If the LATEX_BATCHMODE tag is set to YES, doxygen will add the \\batchmode. 
# command to the generated LaTeX files. This will instruct LaTeX to keep 
# running if errors occur, instead of asking the user for help. 
# This option is also used when generating formulas in HTML.

LATEX_BATCHMODE        = NO

# If LATEX_HIDE_INDICES is set to YES then doxygen will not 
# include the index chapters (such as File Index, Compound Index, etc.) 
# in the output.

LATEX_HIDE_INDICES     = NO

# If LATEX_SOURCE_CODE is set to YES then doxygen will include
# source code with syntax highlighting in the LaTeX output.
# Note that which sources are shown also depends on other settings
# such as SOURCE_BROWSER.

LATEX_SOURCE_CODE      = NO

# The LATEX_BIB_STYLE tag can be used to specify the style to use for the
# bibliography, e.g. plainnat, or ieeetr. The default style is "plain". See
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX for more info.

LATEX_BIB_STYLE        = plain
